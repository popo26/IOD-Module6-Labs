## Exercise 1
• Create a Greeting component, in its own file, which
renders the text “Hello World”.
• Import it into App.jsx, and pass in a prop called ‘name’
when rendering the Greeting component
• If the name prop exists, make sure the Greeting
component replaces ‘World’ with that name value, i.e.
“Hello John”.
• Include support for a greeting message via children.
